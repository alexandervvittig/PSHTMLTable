LONG DESCRIPTION
	PowerShell module to generate HTML tables from an object or list and add inline CSS to them on demand.

	This module is a modified version of HTMLTable originally developed by Warren Frame ("RamblingCookieMonster"). It has been enhanced to include the following additional features:

    * Ability to compare 2 cells within the same row and add CSS attributes to cell, reference cell, or the entire row
    * Ability to add any CSS attributes to tables and id and class tags to rows, and cells
    * Ability to nest multiple tables within a single container table
    * Ability to use "HtmlDecode" on a per table or global page basis
    * Ability to format cells after evaluation
    * Ability to remove "<colgroup></colgroup>" tag
    * Ability to add "<thead></thead>", "<tbody></tbody>", and "<tfoot></tfoot>" tags
    * Updated version number to 1.0.0.0 to avoid conflicts with predecessor
    * Original parameter names can be used for backwards compatibility, see ** BREAKING CHANGE **
    * Separated code from examples to keep code cleaner
    * Theme support
    * Pester Tests

    ** BREAKING CHANGE **
    New-HTMLTable Parameters -HTMLDecode and -SetAlternating have been changed to Switch type instead of Boolean type.
    If you are a previous user to PSHTMLTable and you're switching to this version, you'll need to replace -HTMLDecode $true and -SetAlternating $true to -HTMLDecode and -SetAlternating.
    Alternatively, if you use -HTMLDecode $false or -SetAlternating $false you can remove them.

    You can use and combine several functions to create complete HTML pages:
    
    * New-HTMLHead - Starts building the HTML document and includes internal CSS, specified CSS, or theme (leaves body, html tags open)
    * New-HTMLTable - Creates an HTML table from one or more objects
    * Add-HTMLTableColor - Colorize cells or rows in an HTML table, or add other inline CSS based on user defined criteria
    * Close-HTML - Close out the body and html tags
    * ConvertTo-HTMLPropertyValue - Convert an object with various properties into an array of property, value pairs

    New-HTMLTable just creates a table, not the full HTML around it, thus allowing you to build multiple tables per page.

EXAMPLES
    Sample scripts can be found in the "Examples" folder off of the module's root path
